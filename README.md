# Odin Recipes

#### Description:
This is the project of the HTML foundations of The Odin Project. It requires working with different types of text, creating ordered and unordered lists, creating hypertext and showing images. All images in the website use absolute path because I didn't want to download any content, so I just selected all images from the web.

I upgraded the website after going through all the CSS Foundation section, studying box model and block x inline x inline-block elements. Now I really think the site is very nice-looking. I used a color palette from the website coolors.co (https://coolors.co/f7f7ff-c49991-279af1-60656f-131112).
